# Michigan-Bylaws
A react application that contains the Bylaws for some communities in Michigan. 

## Getting Started

Clone repo into your terminal and create your own branch -- MAKE SURE YOU DON'T FORK REPO BECAUSE WE ARE ALL EDITING OFF THE SAME REPO AND PUSHING TO MASTER

```
create-react-app client
```

I am creating a new react app so you will need to just cd into it

### Prerequisites


```
cd client
```

Install all dependencies inside of the React app

```
yarn or npm install
```

Look inside the ```package.json``` folder to see if there are any other dependencies you might need to install separately before continuing (maybe axios, router, material UI, etc.)

Once your dependencies are installed, run
```
yarn start or npm start
```
to start up the React app
