# Michigan-Bylaws
A react application that contains the Bylaws for some communities in Michigan. 

# Weight Lifting Journal Frontend

It's hard to keep track of how many reps you can do for time, or how much you usually deadlift. 
This app keep it all organized and tracked for you.

## Getting Started

Clone repo into your terminal and create your own branch -- MAKE SURE YOU DON'T FORK REPO BECAUSE WE ARE ALL EDITING OFF THE SAME REPO AND PUSHING TO MASTER

```
create-react-app client
```

I am creating a new react app so you will need to just cd into it

### Prerequisites


```
cd client
```

Install all dependencies inside of the React app

```
yarn or npm install
```

Look inside the ```package.json``` folder to see if there are any other dependencies you might need to install separately before continuing (maybe axios, router, material UI, etc.)

Once your dependencies are installed, run
```
yarn start or npm start
```
to start up the React app
